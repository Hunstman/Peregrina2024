The brainchild of this incredible initiative was conceived by Sara and me, both passionate runners deeply immersed in the world of athletics. Driven by our shared ambition and a strong desire to create positive change, we envisioned a charity project that could seamlessly connect two seemingly distinct realms. Our goal was to bridge the world of athletes with the realm of humanitarianism, forging a common ground with dual objectives – enhancing the happiness of athletes and addressing the needs of those in the community. It was born out of a love for running, a commitment to ambitious goals, and a profound belief that sport can be a powerful force for social good. Thus, the idea for this unique project emerged, with the vision of making a meaningful impact on both the athletic and social fronts.
