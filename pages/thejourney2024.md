During the next adventure, athletes will face the challenges posed by the Alps. Surrounded by magnificent panoramas and astonishing natural landscapes, the runners will ascend thousands of meters, traversing world-renowned Alpine passes such as the Stelvio Pass. The journey will commence from Lecco, at the base of the Alps, where the true test of endurance begins. A preliminary trial will be set in Valsassina, a still predominantly rural area surrounded by magnificent peaks of limestone rocks, sculpted over thousands of years into chimneys and steep peaks. The final stretch of the valley leads downhill towards Lake Como, crossing approximately 50 kilometers of charming old villages.

The heart of the Alps lies not far away. Valtellina, one of the longest and most picturesque Alpine valleys, will be the stage for the run, covering about 200 kilometers until reaching the foot of the Tonale Pass. Here, athletes will face a grueling 20-kilometer ascent with a 2000-meter elevation gain, pushing them to tackle steep sections as temperatures drop from 30 degrees to 5. What follows is like a dream. Athletes will enter Adamello National Park, home of one of the largest glacier in Europe, full of unique mountains renowned worldwide for their distinct shapes and colors. Here, still with approximately 100 kilometers to go before finally reaching Riva del Garda, where an organized AfterParty will await them.
